Swift toolkit that lets you communicate efficiently with many of the [Auth0 API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/info) functions and enables you to seamlessly integrate the Auth0 login.

## Important Notices
[Behaviour changes in iOS 13](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift/pull/297) related to Web Authentication require that developers using Xcode 11 with this library **must** compile using Swift 5.x. This *should* be the default setting applied when updating, unless it has been manually set. However, we recommend checking that this value is set correctly.

## Getting Started

### Authentication with Universal Login (iOS / macOS 10.15+)

1. Import **Auth0** into your project.        
```swift
import Auth0
```

2. Present the Universal Login page.
```swift
Auth0
    .webAuth()
    .audience("https://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/userinfo")
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let credentials):
            print("Obtained credentials: \(credentials)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Failed with \(error)")
        }
    }
```

> This snippet sets the `audience` to ensure OIDC compliant responses, this can also be achieved by enabling the **OIDC Conformant** switch in your Auth0 dashboard under `Application / Settings / Advanced / OAuth`.

3. Allow Auth0 to handle authentication callbacks. In your `AppDelegate.swift`, add the following:

#### iOS

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey: Any]) -> Bool {
    return Auth0.resumeAuth(url)
}
```

#### macOS

```swift
func application(_ application: NSApplication, open urls: [URL]) {
    Auth0.resumeAuth(urls)
}
```

### Configuration

In order to use Auth0 you need to provide your Auth0 **ClientId** and **Domain**.

> Auth0 ClientId & Domain can be found in your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/).

#### Adding Auth0 Credentials

In your application bundle add a `plist` file named `Auth0.plist` with the following information:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>ClientId</key>
  <string>YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID</string>
  <key>Domain</key>
  <string>YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

As an alternative, you can pass the ClientId & Domain programmatically.

```swift
// When using Universal Login
Auth0.webAuth(clientId: "{YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}", domain: "{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}")

// When using the Authentication API
Auth0.authentication(clientId: "{YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}", domain: "{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}")
```

#### Configure Callback URLs (iOS / macOS)

Callback URLs are the URLs that Auth0 invokes after the authentication process. Auth0 routes your application back to this URL and appends additional parameters to it, including a token. Since callback URLs can be manipulated, you will need to add your callback URL to the **Allowed Callback URLs**Â field in the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/). This will enable Auth0 to recognize these URLs as valid. If omitted, authentication will not be successful.

In your application's `Info.plist` file, register your iOS / macOS Bundle Identifer as a custom scheme.

```xml
<!-- Info.plist -->

<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>None</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>auth0</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

> If your `Info.plist` is not shown in this format, you can **Right Click** on `Info.plist` in Xcode and then select **Open As / Source Code**.

Finally, go to your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and make sure that your application's **Allowed Callback URLs** field contains the following entry:

```text
YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/ios/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback
```

e.g. If your bundle identifier was `com.company.myapp` and your Auth0 domain was `company.auth0.com`, then this value would be:

```text
com.company.myapp://company.auth0.com/ios/com.company.myapp/callback
```

## Next Steps

### Learning Resources

Check out the [iOS Swift QuickStart Guide](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ios-swift) to find out more about the Auth0.swift toolkit and explore our tutorials and sample projects.

### Common Tasks

#### Retrieve user information

```swift
Auth0
   .authentication()
   .userInfo(withAccessToken: accessToken)
   .start { result in
       switch result {
       case .success(let profile):
           print("User Profile: \(profile)")
       case .failure(let error):
           print("Failed with \(error)")
       }
   }
```

#### Renew user credentials

Use a [Refresh Token](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/refresh-tokens) to renew user credentials. It's recommended that you read and understand the refresh token process before implementing.

```swift
Auth0
    .authentication()
    .renew(withRefreshToken: refreshToken)
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let credentials):
            print("Obtained new credentials: \(credentials)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Failed with \(error)")
        }
    }
```

#### Disable Single Sign On (iOS 13+ / macOS)

Add the `useEphemeralSession()` method to the chain to disable SSO on iOS 13+ and macOS. This way the system will not display the consent popup that otherwise shows up when SSO is enabled. It has no effect on older versions of iOS.

```swift
Auth0
    .webAuth()
    .audience("https://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/userinfo")
    .useEphemeralSession()
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let credentials):
            print("Obtained credentials: \(credentials)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Failed with \(error)")
        }
    }
```

### Credentials Management Utility

The credentials manager utility provides a convenience to securely store and retrieve the user's credentials from the Keychain.

```swift
let credentialsManager = CredentialsManager(authentication: Auth0.authentication())
```

#### Store Credentials

Store user credentials securely in the Keychain.

```swift
credentialsManager.store(credentials: credentials)
```

#### Retrieve stored credentials 

Credentials will automatically be renewed (if expired) using the refresh token. The scope `offline_access` is required to ensure the refresh token is returned.

> This method is not thread-safe, so if you're using Refresh Token Rotation you should avoid calling this method concurrently (might result in more than one renew request being fired, and only the first one will succeed).

```swift
credentialsManager.credentials { error, credentials in
    guard error == nil, let credentials = credentials else { 
        return print("Failed with \(error)") 
    }
    print("Obtained credentials: \(credentials)")
}
```

#### Clearing credentials and revoking refresh tokens

Credentials can be cleared by using the `clear` function, which clears credentials from the Keychain.

```swift
let didClear = credentialsManager.clear()
```

In addition, credentials can be cleared and the refresh token revoked using a single call to `revoke`. This function will attempt to revoke the current refresh token stored by the credential manager and then clear credentials from the Keychain. If revoking the token results in an error, then the credentials are not cleared:

```swift
credentialsManager.revoke { error in
    guard error == nil else {
        return print("Failed to revoke refresh token: \(error)")
    }
    
    print("Success")
}
```

#### Biometric authentication

You can enable an additional level of user authentication before retrieving credentials using the biometric authentication supported by your device e.g. Face ID or Touch ID.

```swift
credentialsManager.enableBiometrics(withTitle: "Touch to Login")
```

### Native Social Login

#### Sign in With Apple

If you've added [the Sign In with Apple flow](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/implementing_user_authentication_with_sign_in_with_apple) to your app, you can use the string value from the `authorizationCode` property obtained after a successful Apple authentication to perform a token exchange for Auth0 tokens.

```swift
Auth0
    .authentication()
    .login(appleAuthorizationCode: authCode)
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let credentials):
            print("Obtained credentials: \(credentials)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Failed with \(error)")
        }
}
```

Find out more about [Setting up Sign in with Apple](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/apple-siwa/set-up-apple) with Auth0.

#### Facebook Login

If you've added [the Facebook Login flow](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios) to your app, after a successful Faceboook authentication you can request a Session Access Token and the Facebook user profile, and use them to perform a token exchange for Auth0 tokens.

```swift
Auth0
    .authentication()
    .login(facebookSessionAccessToken: sessionAccessToken, profile: profile)
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let credentials):
            print("Obtained credentials: \(credentials)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Failed with \(error)")
        }
}
```

### Authentication API (iOS / macOS / tvOS)

The Authentication API exposes AuthN/AuthZ functionality of Auth0, as well as the supported identity protocols like OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.
We recommend using [Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login) but if you wish to build your own UI, you can use our API endpoints to do so. However, some Auth flows (grant types) are disabled by default so you must enable them via your Auth0 Dashboard as explained in [Update Grant Types](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/update-grant-types).

These are the required Grant Types that needs to be enabled in your application:

* **Password**: For login with username/password using a realm (or connection name). If you set the grants via API you should activate both `http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/password-realm` and `password`, otherwise Auth0 Dashboard will take care of activating both when `Password` is enabled.

#### Login with database connection (via Realm)

```swift
Auth0
    .authentication()
    .login(usernameOrEmail: "support@auth0.com",
           password: "secret-password",
           realm: "Username-Password-Authentication",
           scope: "openid profile")
     .start { result in
         switch result {
         case .success(let credentials):
            print("Obtained credentials: \(credentials)")
         case .failure(let error):
            print("Failed with \(error)")
         }
     }
```

> This requires `Password` Grant or `http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/password-realm`.

#### Sign up with database connection

```swift
Auth0
    .authentication()
    .createUser(email: "support@auth0.com",
                password: "secret-password",
                connection: "Username-Password-Authentication",
                userMetadata: ["first_name": "First", "last_name": "Last"])
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let user):
            print("User Signed up: \(user)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Failed with \(error)")
        }
    }
```

### Management API (Users)

You can request more information about a user's profile and manage the user's metadata by accessing the Auth0 [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2). For security reasons native mobile applications are restricted to a subset of User based functionality.

You can find a detailed guide in this [iOS Swift QuickStart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ios-swift/03-user-sessions#managing-metadata).

#### Link an account

```swift
Auth0
    .users(token: idToken)
    .link("user identifier", withOtherUserToken: "another user token")
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let userInfo):
            print("User: \(userInfo)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Failed with \(error)")
        }
    }
```

### Custom Domains

If you are using [Custom Domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains) and need to call an Auth0 endpoint
such as `/userinfo`, please use the Auth0 domain specified for your Application in the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/).

Example: `.audience("https://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/userinfo")`

Users of Auth0 Private Cloud with Custom Domains still on the [legacy behavior](https://auth0.com/docs/private-cloud/private-cloud-migrations/migrate-private-cloud-custom-domains) need to specify a custom issuer to match the Auth0 domain before starting the authentication. Otherwise, the ID Token validation will fail.

Example: `.issuer("https://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/")`

### Bot Detection

If you are using the [Bot Detection](https://auth0.com/docs/anomaly-detection/bot-detection) feature and performing database login/signup via the Authentication API, you need to handle the `isVerificationRequired` error. It indicates that the request was flagged as suspicious and an additional verification step is necessary to log the user in. That verification step is web-based, so you need to use Universal Login to complete it.

```swift
let email = "support@auth0.com"
let realm = "Username-Password-Authentication"
let scope = "openid profile"

Auth0
    .authentication()
    .login(usernameOrEmail: email,
           password: "secret-password",
           realm: realm,
           scope: scope)
     .start { result in
         switch result {
         case .success(let credentials):
            print("Obtained credentials: \(credentials)")
         case .failure(let error as AuthenticationError) where error.isVerificationRequired:
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                Auth0
                    .webAuth()
                    .connection(realm)
                    .scope(scope)
                    .parameters(["login_hint": email])
                    // âð¼ So the user doesn't have to type it again
                    .start { result in
                        // Handle result
                    }
            }
         case .failure(let error):
            print("Failed with \(error)")
         }
     }
```

In the case of signup, you can add [an additional parameter](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login/new-experience#signup) to make the user land directly on the signup page.

```swift
.parameters(["login_hint": email, "screen_hint": "signup"])
```

Check out how to set up Universal Login in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.

> You don't need to handle this error if you're using the deprecated login methods.

### Logging

To enable Auth0.swift to log HTTP request and OAuth2 flow for debugging you can call the following method in either `WebAuth`, `Authentication` or `Users` object:

```swift
var auth0 = Auth0.authentication()
auth0.logging(enabled: true)
```

Then for a OAuth2 authentication you'll see something similar to the following:

```
Safari: https://samples.auth0.com/authorize?.....
URL: com.auth0.myapp://samples.auth0.com/ios/com.auth0.MyApp/callback?...
POST https://samples.auth0.com/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{"code":"...","client_id":"...","grant_type":"authorization_code","redirect_uri":"com.auth0.MyApp:\/\/samples.auth0.com\/ios\/com.auth0.MyApp\/callback","code_verifier":"..."}

HTTP/1.1 200
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: application/json
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=3600
Date: Thu, 09 Jun 2016 19:04:39 GMT
Content-Length: 57
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: keep-alive

{"access_token":"...","token_type":"Bearer"}
```

> Set this flag only when **DEBUGGING** to avoid leaking user's credentials in the device log.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social identity providers such as **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce** (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/users/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).
