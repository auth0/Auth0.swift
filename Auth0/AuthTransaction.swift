/**
 Represents an ongoing Auth transaction with an Identity Provider (Auth0 or a third party).

 The Auth will be done outside of application control, Safari or third party application.
 The only way to communicate the results back is using a url with a registered custom scheme in your application so iOS can open it on success/failure.
 When that happens iOS will call a method in your `AppDelegate` and that is where you need to handle the result.

 Ideally Auth0.swift will handle the current transaction by itself wether is OAuth2 or Native so you only need to add the following in the AppDelegate
 
 ```
 func application(app: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any]) -> Bool {
    return Auth0.resumeAuth(url, options: options)
 }
 ```

 - important: Only one AuthTransaction can be active at a given time for Auth0.swift, if you start a new one before finishing the current one it will be cancelled.

     - parameter options: options recieved in the openUrl method of the `AppDelegate`
