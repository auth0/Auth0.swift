/**
Represents an ongoing Auth transaction with an Identity Provider (Auth0 or a third party).

The Auth will be done outside of application control, Safari or third party application.
The only way to communicate the results back is using a url with a registered custom scheme in your application so the OS can open it on success/failure.
When that happens the OS will call a method in your `AppDelegate` and that is where you need to handle the result.

- important: Only one AuthTransaction can be active at a given time for Auth0.swift, if you start a new one before finishing the current one it will be cancelled.
