     - Returns: A request.

     ```
     Auth0
         .renew(withRefreshToken: refreshToken)

     - Parameters:
       - refreshToken: The client's refresh token.
       - scope:        Scopes to request for the new tokens. By default is `nil`, which will ask for the same ones requested during Auth.
     - Important: This method only works for a refresh token obtained after auth with OAuth 2.0 API Authorization.
     - Returns: A request that will yield Auth0 user's credentials.
