 Represent a Auth transaction where the user first authenticates with a third party Identity Provider (IdP) and then tries to perform Auth with Auth0.
 This is usually used when a Social connection has a native SDK, e.g. Facebook, and for usability or need to call the IdP API the SDK should be used to login.

 When implementing this protocol you only need to take care of the IdP authentication and yield it's results so the Auth0 part of the flow will be taken care of for you
 
 To accomplish this the results of the IdP authentication should be send using the callback received when the method `func auth(callback: @escaping Callback) -> ()` is called.

 - important: Auth0 only support this for Facebook, Google and Twitter connections.
