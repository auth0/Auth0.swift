# V2 MIGRATION GUIDE

Guide to migrating from `1.x` to `2.x`

## Supported platform versions

The deployment targets for each platform have been raised to:

- iOS 12.0
- macOS 10.15
- Mac Catalyst 13.0
- tvOS 12.0
- watchOS 6.2

## Supported Swift versions

The minimum supported Swift version is now 5.3.

## Supported JWT signature algorithms

ID Tokens signed with the HS256 algorithm are no longer allowed. 
This is because HS256 is a symmetric algorithm, which is not suitable for public clients like mobile apps.
The only algorithm supported now is RS256, an asymmetric algorithm.

If your app is using HS256, you'll need to switch it to RS256 in the dashboard or login will fail with an error:

**Your app's settings > Advanced settings > JSON Web Token (JWT) Signature Algorithm**

## Protocols removed

The following public protocols have been removed:

- `AuthResumable`
- `AuthCancelable`

Both have been subsumed in `AuthTransaction`.

## Type properties changed

### `Credentials` class

The following properties are no longer optional:

- `accessToken`
- `tokenType`
- `expiresIn`
- `idToken`

## Method signatures changed

### Authentication client

The following methods lost the `parameters` parameter:

- `login(phoneNumber:code:audience:scope:)`
- `login(usernameOrEmail:password:realm:audience:scope:)`
- `loginDefaultDirectory(withUsername:password:audience:scope:)`
- `tokenExchange()`

To pass custom parameters to those (or any) method, use the `parameters(_:)` method from `Request`:

```swift
Auth0
    .authentication()
    .tokenExchange() // Returns a Request
    .parameters(["key": "value"]) // üëàüèª
    .start { result in
        print(result)
    }
```

## Behavior changes

### `openid` scope enforced on Web Auth

If the scopes passed via the Web Auth method `.scope(_:)` do not include the `openid` scope, it will be added automatically.

```swift
Auth0
    .webAuth()
    .scope("profile email") // "openid profile email" will be used
    .start { result in
        print(result)
    }
```
